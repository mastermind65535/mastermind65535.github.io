            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                MoniCat project is a prototype of the intrusion detection system (IDS), which currently has a system for detecting rule-based (data-based) intrusion.
                Features currently being studied include "pattern-based detection" to detect attacks using multiple packets, and "AI-based detection," which is AI-based traffic detection.
